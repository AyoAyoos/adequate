Yes, you are missing a few critical libraries that your app needs to run.

Your app will crash on deployment without these.

1.  **`supabase`**: Your `app.py` file uses this to connect to your database.
2.  **`gunicorn`**: This is the production-level server that will actually run your Flask app on the deployment platform.
3.  **`openpyxl`**: You use `pandas.read_excel()` in your app to read `.xlsx` files. Pandas requires this library to do that.
